Android ADK Toolkit: startup without headaches!
===============================================

This toolkit helps beginners to be up and running with ADK 2012 without difficulties.
ADK toolkit exposes an ``AdkManager`` to manage ``UsbManager`` and ``UsbAccessory``. In this way
you don't need to fully understand some background concept about how ADK works because you can
simply access your ADK accessories with a ``readSerial()`` and ``writeSerial()`` methods.

Easy!
